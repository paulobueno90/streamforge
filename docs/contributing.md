## Code Style

### Python Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Use black for formatting (line length: 100)
- Use type hints
- Write docstrings for public APIs

### Example

```python
from typing import List, Optional

def process_symbols(
    symbols: List[str],
    timeframe: str = "1m",
    limit: Optional[int] = None
) -> List[dict]:
    """
    Process cryptocurrency symbols.
    
    Args:
        symbols: List of trading pair symbols
        timeframe: Candle interval (default: "1m")
        limit: Maximum number of results (optional)
        
    Returns:
        List of processed data dictionaries
        
    Example:
        >>> process_symbols(["BTCUSDT"], timeframe="5m")
        [{'symbol': 'BTCUSDT', ...}]
    """
    results = []
    # Implementation...
    return results
```

### Docstring Format

Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def function(arg1: str, arg2: int) -> bool:
    """
    Short description.
    
    Longer description if needed.
    
    Args:
        arg1: Description of arg1
        arg2: Description of arg2
        
    Returns:
        Description of return value
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If arg2 is negative
        
    Example:
        >>> function("test", 5)
        True
    """
    pass
```
